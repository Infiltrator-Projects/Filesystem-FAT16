# Filesystem-FAT16 packaging and installation

**Destination:** [Only FAT16.so is the installed per-format driver](ONE_MODULE_END_STATE.md). The current release workflow and historical artifacts may include additional transitional test binaries. The finished product must package/distribute one validated `FAT16.so` and the existing generic BOOT/kernel infrastructure; do not require separate per-format `.ko` or `.efi` as permanent deliverables. Do not silently install boot artifacts to ESP/NVRAM.

## Artifacts

The original shared-object release convention published two assets; later transitional builds may publish additional individually qualified kernel/EFI test artifacts. The final one-file architecture publishes the selected filesystem as one installed `.so` through its package/installer. Earlier versions published: `infiltrator-filesystem-fat16_X.Y.Z_amd64.deb` and `filesystem-fat16-X.Y.Z-native-installer.run`. GitHub's default `Source code (zip)` and `Source code (tar.gz)` links are generated from the same tag, not uploaded copies. `VERSION` is the only standalone release version authority.

## Package ownership

Debian package identity `infiltrator-filesystem-fat16`. The package owns `/System/Filesystems/FAT16.so` and passive documentation under `/System/Resources/Documentation/Filesystem-FAT16/`. It must NOT own the opposite FAT module, another filesystem, `/usr/lib/filesystems`, or the Defragmenter executable. Reinstall or removal targets only the selected module. A previous Filesystems selector may have installed an unowned module at the same path; confirm ownership and upgrade behaviour before retiring its installer.

## Generic and native builds

The generic package uses an x86-64 portable C11 compile, LTO where configured, and exact format and ABI checks. The source `.run` embeds the matching full repository source archive and its SHA-256, extracts to temporary private storage, recompiles on the local CPU with `-O3 -march=native -mtune=native -flto`, validates module identity and installs `X.Y.Z+native1` via dpkg. It accepts `--profile aggressive --system-package-mode`. Hardware-native PGO training is not asserted until an actual training/qualification implementation exists.

## InfiltratorOS

InfiltratorOS should launch two separately tracked and checksum-verified filesystem module installers, verify each package and native build metadata, and preserve the existing module loader path. It must not claim successful installation when either release, build or installed module is missing.

## Publication rules

Pull requests build and test without publishing. A protected main commit qualifies in CI; only a successful exact revision is tagged and published, never mutating an existing public release. GitHub's source ZIP must include the full local source and licence notices. The old Filesystems release remains untouched until the new module package has independently passed installation and Defragmenter integration.
