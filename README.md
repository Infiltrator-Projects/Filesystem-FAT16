# Filesystem-FAT16

Independent InfiltratorOS FAT16 filesystem repository. One repository is authoritative for exactly one installed shared-object module: `/System/Filesystems/FAT16.so`.

## Actual status

The full source was copied from Infiltrator-Projects/Filesystems, pinned to commit `d7a572dcd0d11f7bc69cc05e09e3e944be747838`, including the FAT filesystem interface, its FAT-specific defragmentation and recovery engine, portable FatFs, the Linux VFS source, TianoCore EFI driver source, tests, and Common support source. Import alone is NOT a qualified standalone release.

`make` builds `build/FAT16.so` solely from this repository. `make check` checks module exports, format identity, and the existing standalone FAT fixture. `make release` produces the generic `.deb` and native `.run`; a published GitHub release tag supplies GitHub's automatic source ZIP (not a third uploaded asset). Releases are permitted only when the exact HEAD qualifies in CI.

## Ownership

- This repository: fat16 interpretation, read/write/file APIs, formatting, allocation, fat16 relocation, journal/recovery, format-specific kernel and EFI source and tests.
- Filesystems: discovery, selection and management; it must not silently overwrite or install a second copy of this module after package ownership transfers.
- Defragmenter: the worker and UI; it dynamically loads the installed `FAT16.so` and calls `infiltrator_filesystem_defrag_v1` via the existing versioned host ABI.
- Linux: module `fat16.ko` is experimental and requires a compatible host FAT core. Firmware `FAT16.efi` uses a pinned EDK2 framework. Those two formats are NOT included in the initial `.so` package; independent qualification and separate installer policy are required first.

## Filesystem qualification scope

FAT16 16-bit allocation entries, fixed-root FAT directory and cluster count between 4,085 and 65,524. Reject foreign formats, malformed geometry and ambiguous boundaries before changes. The independent `.so` exposes V1, V3 and V4 filesystem interfaces plus its defragmentation/recovery interface; supported operations, limitations and required test evidence are tracked in [Validation](docs/VALIDATION.md) and [API](docs/API.md). Destructive testing must use disposable images only.
